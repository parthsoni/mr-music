Mr.Music will merge your local media library with a remote daap server (mt-daapd/Firefly, forked-daap, rhythmbox, tangerine, FreeNAS, QNAP, etc). Remote files can be downloaded into your local library individually, by Artist or by Album.

Mr.Music will work fine as a stand alone music player but to make the most of it you will need a <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Audio_Access_Protocol'>daap</a> server. Use it to manage your device library without having to sit at a computer.

Big thanks to <a href='http://code.google.com/p/daap-client/'>daap-client</a> -- the starting point of this project and the source of the daap code.
