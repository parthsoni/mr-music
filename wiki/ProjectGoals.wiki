#summary Why Mr.Music?

*Project Goals*

Mr.Music was born from a desire to sync music to an Android phone without the messiness of actually sitting down at a computer and copying files.

To that end, Mr.Music should:
  # Connect to a remote music source
  # Connect to a local (on device) music source
  # Easily copy files from 1->2
  # Play files regardless of source

Other features that a music player have:
  # Scrobble support
  # Searchable
  # Widgets/lockscreen controls
  # and....
